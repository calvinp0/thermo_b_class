    "You have been provided with the chemical data for two components, Methane and Propane. The chemical data is stored in the DataFrame `chemical_data_df`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The mol fractions of the components are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $x_{CH_4}$ = 0.4\n",
    "* $x_{C_3H_8}$ = 0.6\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a table of the chemical data for the two components, Methane<sub>2</sub> and Propane<sub>2</sub>. The table should be called `chemical_data_df_binary_mixture`. It should have the following columns:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    * `Methane`\n",
    "    * `Propane`\n",
    "\n",
    "    It then should have the following index:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    * `mol_frac`\n",
    "    * `Tc_K`\n",
    "    * `Pc_MPa`\n",
    "    * `w`\n",
    "    * `ai`\n",
    "    * `bi`\n",
    "    * `ki`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Fill in the table with the correct values. The values for the `mol_frac` column should be the mol fractions of the components. The values for the `Tc_K` column should be the critical temperature of the components. The values for the `Pc_MPa` column should be the critical pressure of the components. The values for the `w` column should be the acentric factor of the components. The values for the `ai` column should be the attraction parameter of the component. The values for the `bi` column should be the covolume for the component. The values for the `ki` column should be the binary interaction of component.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Tip***: Creating an empty table (or rather, DataFrame) can be done using the `pd.DataFrame()` function. The function takes the following arguments: `pd.DataFrame(columns, index)`. The index argument is the index of the DataFrame and the columns argument is the columns of the DataFrame. These both accept only lists - `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Tip***: You will need to use the `chemical_data_df` DataFrame to get the values for the `Tc_K`, `Pc_MPa` and `w` columns. You will need to use the `ai()` function to get the values for the `ai` column. You will need to use the `bi()` function to get the values for the `bi` column. You will need to use the `ki()` function to get the values for the `ki` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Tip***: Access rows and setting them will require the use of the `.loc[]` function. The function takes the following arguments: `.loc[column]`. The column argument is the column to be accessed. The function will return the row of the column. To set the row of the column, you will need to use the following syntax: `.loc[column] = row`. The column argument is the column to be accessed. The row argument is the row to be set. Ensure the column is a string and the row is a list."
