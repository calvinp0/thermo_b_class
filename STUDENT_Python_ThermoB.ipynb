However, the plot will not be shown in the notebook. You will need to use the `plt.show()` function to display the plot. Additionally, you will need to use the `plt.figure(figsize(width, height))` function to set the size of the plot. Recommended is a width of 10 and a height of 10. You will also need to use the `plt.title()`. function to set the title of the plot. You can use the `plt.xlabel()` and `plt.ylabel()` functions.to set the x and y axis labels. Also, set the y axis limits using `plt.ylim()` functions.\n",

Taken at the same temperature and pressure, the difference between the molar Gibbs free energies of a real gas and the corresponding ideal gas is equal to RT $ln(φ)$ [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugacity).
